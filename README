Google Chrome extension that strips Google Analytics (i.e. Urchin
Traffic Monitor) tokens from URL query strings.

The Google Analytics query string parameters are documented here:

NOTE: This fork of this extension strips the tokens before the request is made.  This mostly likely violates terms for Google so I am not submitting this to the marketplace.  If you're not looking to block the tracking behavior, just install the original extension from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kcpnkledgcbobhkgimpbmejgockkplob
